   - `vercel.json`
   - `package.json`
   - `.gitignore`
3. Add commit message: "Add Vercel configuration files"

- ‚úÖ `package.json` file

### **Step 4: Wait for Vercel Deployment**
1. Vercel will automatically detect the changes
2. It will redeploy your website
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

### **Step 5: Test Your Website**
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Check that:
   - Website loads with proper styling
   - All images display correctly
   - Navigation works on all pages
   - Mobile responsive design works

## **Alternative: Install Git (Recommended for Future)**

### **Quick Git Installation:**
1. Download: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Install with default settings
3. Restart computer
4. Use automated scripts for future uploads

## **Files That Must Be Uploaded:**

### **Critical Folders:**
- `css/` - Contains `style.css` (website styling)
- `js/` - Contains `script.js` (website functionality)
- `images/` - Contains all website images and icons

### **Configuration Files:**
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `package.json` - Project metadata
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

## **Why This Fixes Your Website:**

Your website isn't working because:
- ‚ùå CSS files are missing (no styling)
- ‚ùå JavaScript files are missing (no functionality)
- ‚ùå Images are missing (no images display)
- ‚ùå Configuration files are missing (deployment issues)

After uploading these files:
- ‚úÖ Website will have proper styling
- ‚úÖ Navigation will work correctly
- ‚úÖ All images will display
- ‚úÖ Vercel deployment will work properly
